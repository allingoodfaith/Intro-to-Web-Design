<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>
    These are our drums
    This is our melody
    (Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da)
    Now listen closely, as our drums become our melody 
</p>
<p>
    And here's our song
    Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
    Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
</p>
<p>
    So let me play my violin for you (bang, bang, bang)
    Ah, ah-ah
    Ah-ah
    So let me play my violin for you
    The truth is that I'm screwed
    Still, Joe, do you think I'm cool?
</p>
<p>
    I got friends in a lot of weird places
    Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my face is (one, two, three, four)
    I got friends in a lot of weird places
    Wonder if they're gonna call, depending what my face is
    Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
    Yeah-yeah-yeah-yea
</p>
<p>
    Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
    When Humpty Dumpty went down
    He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
    And I'll scream when no one's around"
    Humpty Dumpty, when Humpty Dumpty
    When Humpty Dumpty went down
    He said, "Screw it, I'ma smile right through it
    And I'll scream when no one, when no one
    When no one's around, around, around, around"
</p>
<p>
    Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
    And I'll scream when no one, when no one
    When no one's around
</p>
<p>
    One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
    I'll become a trumpet or a drum set in a sad orchestra
    One day, maybe someday, in a world speeding up
    It's getting hard, so very hard to keep up
    One day, maybe someday, I'll be so out of touch
    I'll become a trumpet or a drum set
    In a sad orchestra
    One day, I won't know what to write
    And I can't be eighteen my whole life
    But I'm too fuckin' young to feel so fuckin' old
    But I'll try and I'll try and I'll try
    But I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
</p>
<p>
    Bang, bang, bang
    But I'm way less sad
    Adventure is out there
    But you gotta be some
    Come on, guy
    Bang, bang, bang
    But it's all I have
    Oh, I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright
</p>
