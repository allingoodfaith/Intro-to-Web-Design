            I got Baulder’s Gate 3 pretty quick after it came out at the behest of my sister. I really enjoy playing it as I’m a big DnD fan. I often play with my sister and a few other folks. I want to play more by myself but I tend to enjoy playing with other people more. The story is pretty fun and engaging. I have a couple of characters and I would like to be able to play through all the classes at some point.

            Hades is a wonderful game for any fan of Rouge-lites. Supergiant brings their A game with the art and music as usual. It has such a fun gameplay loop that even folks that usually aren’t Rouge-lite fans, like myself, are able to enjoy the game and story. Zagerus is a fun protagonist to play. The ability to develop his relationships with fellow gods and those of the underworld is a great way to create the game’s narrative. It also makes me wish for a Supergiant dating sim.

        <div class="secondary-container">
            Splatoon has been the first shooter type game I have ever played and really enjoy. It’s colorful charm and characters really endears it to me. I’ve never been a fan of realistic or military shooters so a game that is bright and fun as Splatoon is what really brought me to the genre. I play with friends or even by myself as a way to let out some steam after doing a lot of homework. Salmon Run is one of my favorite game modes as it's more collaborative in nature then the other modes.

        <div class="secondary-container">
            Stardew Valley is the most recent game I’ve picked up. Farming sims are a genre that I figured I would enjoy and Stardew is a very popular and accessible game. I’ve had it for a while, just never had the time to play it. I’m still pretty early on in the game so there’s a bunch I haven’t experienced yet but I’m excited.
